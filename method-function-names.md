## Naming Methods and Functions

##### Basic Rule in naming methods and functions

Prefer using present tense verbs

- [x] sing
- [x] dance
- [x] jump

##### :no_entry_sign: Avoid verbs contains -ing and past tense

> :gem: using this names are unclear about when things to get happen or things that already happen.

:x: singing

:x: dancing

:x: jumping

Past tense

:x: danced

:x: jumped


To fix this we can use prefix `is_` on verbs contains -ing

- [x] is_singing
- [x] is_dancing
- [x] is_jumping

Prefix with `has_` on past tense verbs

- [x] has_jumped
- [x] has_danced

Prefix with `get_` or `set_` if returning or setting a variable
